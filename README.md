# coursera-machine-learning
##### My attempt at Andrew's Ng Machine Learning course on Coursera.

## Week 1
### 4 Sep 2018
#### Introduction
* Welcome to Machine Learning
* What is Machine Learning
* Supervised Learning
  * Data with "the right answer"
  * 2 main types of problems: regression (prediction, curve-fitting) & classification (0 or 1)
* Unsupervised Learning
  * Data without a "right answer": machine attempts to find structure in the data
  * Examples given: splitting 2 audio streams into distinct tracks + clustering algorithms
